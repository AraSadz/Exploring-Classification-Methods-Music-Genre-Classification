# Exploring-Classification-Methods: Music-Genre-Classification
In this notebook, different classification methods are explored and employed for the music genre classification. At first, data exploration and cleaning is carried out. Then, different classification methods are applied on our dataset. Subsequently, we consider boosting and stacking of the obtained models to improve the classification performance. Lastly, model interpretability is considered and explored for the final proposed model.
